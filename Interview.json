And another thing was that, um, both of my brothers showed me a lot of pornography, it seems like they had magazines, my dad had movies, like hard core porn, and so I saw all this stuff as a really young kid, like pre-school age, and I think that also gave me a sense that people could lead dual lives, you know, that like perfectly normal looking people were doing these things and movies, or enjoying watching people doing these things, because I knew they were my parents, I knew they watched them.

And I also have come to honor just who she is, you know, like she’s a product of her family just like I’m a product of mine, so I can’t expect her to do certain things, like, I don’t know, like support me in a relationship with another woman, like she’s come a really long way with that, because I was going out with S. and my mom, you know, there was some parts of that that she couldn’t deal with, although I must say, she’s a lot better than S.’s parents would have been (chuckles).

And she recently was diagnosed with a lymphoma and so she’s okay now, they got it like at a really early stage and it was very localized and, you know, it’s turned out to be an okay thing, but it was very scary in the beginning and she went through chemo, and so we’ve recently just like really come together to support each other through that, so it’s hard for me to think too much about all the shitty things that she did (chuckling)."},{"typePerson":1,"stamp":57,"content":"Mm hmm.

It was really scary, and it’s so hard because you can’t just deal with that information, you have to deal with how everyone else is feeling with it too, like, I don’t know, I remember my dad was really odd about it and my grandmother, um, and my dad’s mother and my mom’s mother is dead, so it was my dad and my paternal grandmother like both had reactions that I found very hard to deal with, like I can’t even remember what they were but I just remember like I had to pretend like everything was okay around my grandmother, and my dad said something pretty insensitive like, well, you know, you know this is going to happen at some point, which is true, but you don’t say that to someone like in the moment, it’s just not a helpful thing to hear, you know, like when they’re healthy you can talk about, well, when your mother and I die, like these are the arrangements and blah, blah, blah, but when it’s an actual possibility, like why would you say that to a child, not that I’m a child."},{"typePerson":1,"stamp":65,"content":"Hm.

And I also became very proactive in thinking about ways to help her because, um, I’ve been studying herbalism and so I knew a lot, I mean I have a lot of information about different like (inaudible) and things that she could take to support her body through the chemotherapy and through the radiation, which she actually hasn’t done yet, so we’re not completely out of the woods but she’s got…my mom is so strong, she’s like…I was like, mom, how did your chemotherapy go, she’s like, oh fine, I biked 20 miles today, I’m like, God, I’d be a wreck, and she’s just got this amazing constitution.  So, after, um, the worst part was before and during the first chemo, like that was really hard, but then she’s so positive and she’s so healthy, like she never felt sick, except after they poked all the drugs in her.

I think I felt like when we were together, when S. and I were together, I was the functional one and she was the sick one, because she had like meltdowns sort of routinely, you know, every month she’d like have one thing or another happen.  Um, and so I was the strong one and we broke up and it was like now I can fall apart, and then sort of lost the context for who I was, you know, I don’t know, when I’m in a relationship with someone I sort of build myself opposite of them, I sort of adapt myself to what I think that person expects of me."},{"typePerson":1,"stamp":87,"content":"Mm.
